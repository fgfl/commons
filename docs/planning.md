# Commons App

## Description

Commons is a web application that delivers up to date information about the content and status of bills in session in Canadian Parliament. Commons lets users watch specific bills based on interests, find and contact their MP.

## Target Audience

We identified a huge opportunity to make government legislation information accessible to the public. The sites that exist now are extremely difficult to understand and not user friendly at all. Commons solves this issue by providing a seamless user experience for engaging with your MP and staying up to date with what's happening in parliament. The target audience is Canadians interested in engaging with the democratic process regardless of age, race, status, or gender.
